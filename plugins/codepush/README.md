# CodePush Expo Plugin

This Expo Plugin makes the necessary changes to the following files to support our
CodePush setup:

1. `AppDelegate.mm`
2. `Info.plist`
3. `MainActivity.kt`

The files inside of this directory's `ios` and `android` subdirs are not necessary, but are
left as an example of what `yarn prebuild` should output inside the main `ios` and `android`
directories.
